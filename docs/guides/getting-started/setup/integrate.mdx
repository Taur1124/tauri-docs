# Integrate into Existing Project

If you already have an existing web project, this guide will walk you through integrating Tauri into your project, whether it is Node.js-based (like [Svelte], [React], [Vue], or [Angular]) or Rust-based (like [Yew] or [Dominator]).

:::info

Before we continue, make sure you have completed the [prerequisites] to have a working development environment.

:::

Although Tauri is compatiable with nearly any frontend framework, we'll use a [React] project throughout this guide created using [create-react-app]. We'll be assuming you're starting off with a project structure similar to this:

```
.
│── package.json
│── public
│   ╰── index.html
╰── src
    │── App.css
    │── App.jsx
    │── index.css
    ╰── index.js
```

## Create the Rust Project

<TauriInit
  destDirExplination={{
    __html:
      'Use the path where your compiled web assets will be located. This may be something like <code>../dist</code> or <code>../build</code>.',
  }}
  devPathExplination={{
    __html:
      'This is the path or address your frontend is served at during development. If servering from localhost this could be <code>https://localhost:3000</code>. This can also be a directory similar to the above question.',
  }}
  beforeDevCommandExplination={{
    __html:
      'Use <code>npm run dev</code> for this value (be sure to adapt to use your package manager of choice).',
  }}
  beforeBuildCommandExplination={{
    __html:
      'Use <code>npm run build</code> for this value (be sure to adapt to use your package manager of choice).',
  }}
/>

And that's it, you have now added Tauri to your existing project and you should see a `src-tauri` directory that looks something like this:

```diff {9-14}
│── package.json
│── public
│   ╰── index.html
│── src
│   │── App.css
│   │── App.jsx
│   │── index.css
│   ╰── index.js
╰── src-tauri
    │── Cargo.toml
    │── build.rs
    │── icons
    │── src
    ╰── tauri.conf.json
```

## Invoke Commands

There are two different ways you can invoke commands from your frontend project:

1. Using the [`@tauri-apps/api`] JavaScript library (preferred)
2. Using [`withGlobalTauri`] to use a pre-bundled version of the Tauri API

:::tip

The rest of this section assumes you're using the [`@tauri-apps/api`] library. If you want to use [`withGlobalTauri`] instead, we recommend following the [Invoke Commands] section of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript guide instead.

:::

<Commands />

To call our newly created command we will use the [`@tauri-apps/api`] JavaScript library. It provides access to core functionality such as windows, the filesystem, and more through convenient JavaScript abstractions. You can install it using your favorite JavaScript package manager:

<InstallTauriApi />

```jsx title=src/App.js {4,7-12}
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api'

function App() {
  // now we can call our Command!
  // Right-click the application background and open the developer tools.
  // You will see "Hello, World!" printed in the console!
  invoke('greet', { name: 'World' })
  // `invoke` returns a Promise
  .then((response) => console.log(response))

  return (
    // -- snip --
  )
}
```

You can now run the following command in your terminal to start a development build of your app:

<Command name="dev" />
