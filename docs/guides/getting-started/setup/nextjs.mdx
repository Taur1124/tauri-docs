# Next.js

This guide will walk you through creating your first Tauri app using the React Framework [Next.js][nextjs].

<Intro />

Here's a preview of what we will be building:

## Create the Frontend

[Next.js][nextjs] is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application. To make NextJS work with Tauri we are going to use the SSG mode since it generates only static files that can be included in the final binary.

Next.js comes with a scaffolding utility similar to `create-tauri-app` that can quickly setup a new project from a number of [pre-defined templates](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples). You can choose from many templates like with-cms, with-tailwindcss and many many more. For this guide we will select the `with-typescript` template to create a simple project.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```shell
npm create vite@latest
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn create vite
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm create vite
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

1. **Project name**  
   This will be the name of your JavaScript project. Corresponds to the name of the folder this utility will create but has otherwise no effect on your app. You can use any name you want here.

2. **Select a framework**  
   If you plan on using a frontend framework later, this is where you can select it. For this guide, we assume you choose `vanilla`.

3. **Select a variant**  
   Vite offers [TypeScript] and vanilla JavaScript variants for all templates, and you can select the variant here. We **strongly** recommend TypeScript as it helps you write more secure, maintainable code faster and more efficiently. For this guide, we assume you choose `vanilla-ts`.

When starting the frontend via the `vite` command, Vite will look for a config file named `vite.config.ts` inside the project root. We want to customize this file to get the best compatibility with Tauri. If it is not created by the scaffolding above (such as if you're using vanilla JavaScript), you may need to create the `vite.config.ts` file in the root directory of the project.

Update the file with the following content:

```typescript title=vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  // prevent vite from obscuring rust errors
  clearScreen: false,
  // Tauri expects a fixed port, fail if that port is not available
  server: {
    strictPort: true,
  },
  // to make use of `TAURI_PLATFORM`, `TAURI_ARCH`, `TAURI_FAMILY`,
  // `TAURI_PLATFORM_VERSION`, `TAURI_PLATFORM_TYPE` and `TAURI_DEBUG`
  // env variables
  envPrefix: ['VITE_', 'TAURI_'],
  build: {
    // Tauri supports es2021
    target: ['es2021', 'chrome100', 'safari13'],
    // don't minify for debug builds
    minify: !process.env.TAURI_DEBUG ? 'esbuild' : false,
    // produce sourcemaps for debug builds
    sourcemap: !!process.env.TAURI_DEBUG,
  },
})
```

## Create the Rust Project

<TauriInit destDirValue="../dist" devPathValue="http://localhost:5173" />

Now that we have scaffolded our Frontend and initialized the Rust project you're almost ready to run your App.
But before you do, let's quickly configure Tauri so it **automatically** start's the vite development server when you type `tauri dev` and automatically runs the build script when you run `tauri build`:

```json title=src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
{
  "build": {
    // highlight-start
    // this command will execute when you run `tauri build`
    "beforeBuildCommand": "npm run build",
    // this command will execute when you run `tauri dev`
    "beforeDevCommand": "npm run dev",
    // highlight-end
    "devPath": "http://localhost:5173",
    "distDir": "../dist"
  },
```

And that's it! Now you can run the following command in your terminal to start a development build of your app:

<Command name="dev" />

![Application Window](./vite-dev-light.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![Application Window](./vite-dev-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

## Invoke Commands

<Commands />

To call our newly created command we will use the [`@tauri-apps/api`] JavaScript library. It provides access to core functionality such as windows, the filesystem, and more through convenient JavaScript abstractions. You can install it using your favorite JavaScript package manager:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```shell
npm install @tauri-apps/api
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn add @tauri-apps/api
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm add @tauri-apps/api
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With the library installed, you can modify your `main.ts` file to call the Command:

```typescript title=src/main.ts
import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api'

// now we can call our Command!
// Right-click the application background and open the developer tools.
// You will see "Hello, World!" printed in the console!
invoke('greet', { name: 'World' })
  // `invoke` returns a Promise
  .then((response) => console.log(response))
```
