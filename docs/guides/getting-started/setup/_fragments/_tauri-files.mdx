The `tauri init` command generates a folder called `src-tauri`. It's a convention for Tauri apps to place all core-related files into this folder. Let's quickly run through the contents of this folder:

- **`Cargo.toml`**

  Cargo's manifest file. You can declare Rust crates your app depends on, metadata about your app, and much more. For the full reference see [Cargo's Manifest Format][manifest-format].

- **`tauri.conf.json`**

  This file lets you configure and customize aspects of your Tauri application from the name of your app to the list of allowed APIs. See [Tauri's API Configuration][api config] for the full list of supported options and in-depth explanations for each.

- **`src/main.rs`**

  This is the entrypoint to your Rust program and the place where we bootstrap into Tauri. You will find two sections in it:

  ```rust title=src/main.rs
   #![cfg_attr(
      all(not(debug_assertions), target_os = "windows"),
      windows_subsystem = "windows"
   )]

  fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
     .run(tauri::generate_context!())
     .expect("error while running tauri application");
  }
  ```

  The line beginning with [`cfg! macro`][cfg macro] serves just one purpose: it disables the command prompt window that would normally pop up on Windows if you run a bundled app. If you're on Windows, try to comment it out and see what happens.

  The `main` function is the entry point and the first function that gets invoked when your program runs.

- **`icons`**

  Chances are you want a snazzy icon for your app! To get you going quickly, we included a set of default icons. You should switch these out before publishing your application. Learn more about the various icon formats in Tauri's [icons feature guide][icons].
