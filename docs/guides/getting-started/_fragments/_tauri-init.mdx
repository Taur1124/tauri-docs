At the heart of every Tauri app is a Rust binary that manages windows, the webview and calls to the operating system through a Rust crate called `tauri`. This project is managed by [Cargo], the official package manager and general-purpose build tool for Rust.

Our Tauri CLI uses Cargo under the hood so you rarely need to interact with it directly. Cargo has many more useful features that are not exposed through our CLI, such as testing, linting, and formatting, so please refer to their [official docs][cargo commands] for more.

:::info Install Tauri CLI

If you haven't installed the Tauri CLI yet you can do so with with one of the below commands. Aren't sure which to use? Check out the [FAQ entry].

:::

To scaffold a minimal Rust project that is pre-configured to use Tauri, open a terminal and run the following command:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```shell
npm tauri init
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn tauri init
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm tauri init
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cargo" label="Cargo">

```shell
cargo tauri init
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

It will walk you through a series of questions:

1. **What is your app name?**

   This will be the name of your final bundle and what the OS will call your app. You can use any name you want here.

2. **What should the window title be?**

   This will be the title of the default main window. You can use any title you want here.

3. **Where are your web assets (HTML/CSS/JS) located relative to the `<current dir>/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file that will be created?**

   <div>
     This is the path that Tauri will load your frontend assets from when
     building for <b>production</b>. Use <code>{props.destDirValue}</code> for
     this value.
   </div>

4. **What is the URL of your dev server?**

   <div>
     This can be either a URL or a file path that Tauri will load during{' '}
     <b>development</b>. Use <code>{props.devPathValue}</code> for this value.
   </div>

5. ** What is your frontend dev command?**

   <div>
     This is the command to start your frontend dev server. Use{' '}
     {props.beforeDevCommandValue ? (
       <code>{props.beforeDevCommandValue}</code>
     ) : (
       <span>an empty string</span>
     )}{' '}
     for this value.
   </div>

6. ** What is your frontend build command?**
   <div>
     This the the command to build your frontend files. Use{' '}
     {props.beforeBuildCommandValue ? (
       <code>{props.beforeBuildCommandValue}</code>
     ) : (
       <span>an empty string</span>
     )}{' '}
     for this value.
   </div>

:::info

If you're familiar with Rust, you will notice that `tauri init` looks and works a lot like `cargo init`. You can just use `cargo init` and add the necessary Tauri dependencies if you prefer a fully manual setup.
