To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and enter this command:

```shell
rustc --version
```

You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the latest stable version that has been released in the following format:

```text
rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)
```

If you don't see this information, your Rust installation might be broken. Please consult [Rust's Troubleshooting Section] on how to fix this. If your problems persist, you can get help from the official [Tauri Discord] and [GitHub Discussions].
