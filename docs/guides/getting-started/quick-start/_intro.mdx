<!-- TODO: add a short tauri explanation  -->
A Tauri app consists of two parts:

1. Rust binary that creates the windows and exposes native
   functionality to those windows
2. Frontend of your choice that produces the User Interface inside the
   window

In the following, we will first scaffold the Frontend, then set up the
Rust project and lastly show you how to communicate between the two.

:::tip `create-tauri-app`

The easiest way to scaffold a new project is the
[`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app)
utility. It will ask you a series of questions and quickly bootstrap a
Tauri project for you to begin developing with. It has support for
vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript but also many frontend frameworks like
React, Vue, or Svelte.
