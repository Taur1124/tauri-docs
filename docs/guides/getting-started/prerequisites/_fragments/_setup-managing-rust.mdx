You should keep your Rust version up to date whenever possible to always benefit from the latest improvements. To update Rust, open a terminal and run the following command:

```shell
rustup update
```

`rustup` can also be used to uninstall Rust from your machine fully:

```shell
rustup self uninstall
```
