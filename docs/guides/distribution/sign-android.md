# Android - Sigining APKs and AABs

To publish on the Play Store, you need to give your app a digital signature. Use the following instructions to sign your app.
On Android, there are two signing keys: deployment and upload. The end-users download the .apk signed with the "deployment key". An "upload key" is used to authenticate the .aab / .apk uploaded by developers onto the Play Store and is re-signed with the deployment key once in the Play Store.

- It's highly recommended to use the automatic cloud managed signing for the deployment key. For more information, see the [official Play Store documentation](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423?hl=en).

## Create an `upload` Keystore

If you have an existing keystore, skip to the next step. If not, create one by either:

- Following the [Android Studio key generation steps](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk)
- Running the following at the command line:

  On Mac/Linux, use the following command:

  ```
  keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
  ```

  On Windows, use the following command:

  ```
  keytool -genkey -v -keystore %userprofile%\upload-keystore.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
  ```

  This command stores the `upload-keystore.jks` file in your home directory. If you want to store it elsewhere, change the argument you pass to the `-keystore` parameter. **However, keep the keystore file private; don't check it into public source control!**

:::note

- The `keytool` command might not be in your pathâ€”it's part of Java, which is installed as part of Android Studio. You may find it installed in the JDK that is installed with Android Studio, for example:.

  - Linux: `/opt/android-studio/jbr/bin/keytool`
  - macOS: `/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/bin/keytool`
  - Windows: `C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jbr\\bin\\keytool.exe`

  Then use that fully qualified path. If your path includes space-separated names, such as Program Files, use platform-appropriate notation for the names. For example, on Mac/Linux use `Program\ Files`, and on Windows use `"Program Files"`.

- The `-storetype JKS` tag is only required for Java 9 or newer. As of the Java 9 release, the keystore type defaults to PKS12.

## Reference the Keystore from the App

Create a file named `[project]/src-tauri/gen/android/[your-app]/local.properties` that contains a reference to your keystore:

```
storePassword=<password from previous step>
keyPassword=<password from previous step>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=<location of the key store file, such as /Users/<user name>/upload-keystore.jks or C:\\Users\\<user name>\\upload-keystore.jks>
```

:::caution
Keep the `local.properties` file private; don't check it into public source control.

## Configure Signing in Gradle

Configure gradle to use your upload key when building your app in release mode by editing the `[project]/src-tauri/gen/android/[your-app]/app/build.gradle.kts` file.

1. Add the needed imports at the beginning of the file

   ```kotlin
   import java.util.Properties
   import java.io.FileInputStream
   ```

2. Add the keystore information from your properties file before the `android` block:

   ```kotlin {1-3}
   val localPropertiesFile = rootProject.file("local.properties")
   val localProperties = Properties()
   localProperties.load(FileInputStream(localPropertiesFile))

   android {
      ...
   }
   ```

3. Add the `release` signing config before the `buildTypes` block:

   ```kotlin {1-8}
   signingConfigs {
      create("release") {
          keyAlias = localProperties["keyAlias"] as String
          keyPassword = localProperties["keyPassword"] as String
          storeFile = file(localProperties["storeFile"] as String)
          storePassword = localProperties["storePassword"] as String
      }
   }

   buildTypes {
      ...
   }
   ```

4. Use the new `release` signing config in the `release` buildTypes

   ```kotlin {5}
   buildTypes {
     ...
     getByName("release") {
       ...
       signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
     }
   }
   ```

Release builds of your app will now be signed automatically.
