Within the rust folder on this site you can find all of the latest rust api documentation.

If you prefer you can find all of the tauri crates on <a href="https://crates.io/search?q=tauri" target="_blank">crates.io</a> and browse each crate's documentation on docs.rs.

Tauri's development is split into multiple crates, the three main ones are <a href="https://docs.rs/tauri/" target="_blank">tauri</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/tauri_api/" target="_blank">tauri_api</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/tauri_utils/" target="_blank">tauri_utils</a>. These are the three you'll want to reference while making your Tauri app.
