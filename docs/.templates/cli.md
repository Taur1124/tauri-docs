import Command from '@theme/Command'

The `cli.js` command line interface is composed in TypeScript and published as a JavaScript NPM. It offers the `deps` and the `icon` commands, and propagates other commands to `cli.rs`.

## `info`

<Command name="info" />

{info}

It shows a concise list of information about the environment, Rust, Node.js and their versions as well as some relevant configurations.

:::note
This command is pretty helpful when you need to have a quick overview of your application. When requesting some help, it can be useful that you share this report with us.
:::

## `init`

<Command name="init" />

{init}

## `dev`

<Command name="dev" />

{dev}

This command will open the WebView in development mode. It makes use of the `build.devPath` property from your `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file.

If you have entered a command to the `build.beforeDevCommand` property, this one will be executed before the `dev` command.

:::caution
If you're not using `build.beforeDevCommand`, make sure your `build.devPath` is correct and, if using a development server, that it's started before using this command.
:::

## `deps`

<Command name="deps" />

{deps}

## `build`

<Command name="build" />

{build}

This command will bundle your application, either in production mode or debug mode if you used the `--debug` flag. It makes use of the `build.distDir` property from your `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file.

If you have entered a command to the `build.beforeBuildCommand` property, this one will be executed before the `build` command.
