# Migration to `webkit2gtk-4.1` on Linux port!

Hello everybody! We just release another alpha version lately. While it doesn't bring any major features, it does bring some huge impact on Linux port.
We will use [WebKit2GTKâ€“4.1](https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/index.html) in 2.0 from now on.

<!--truncate-->

## What does this mean?

If you are using Tauri version 1.x, there's nothing to worry about. Everything you need is still the same.
But if you are using Tauri version 2.0 alpha version starting from `alpha.3`, you will need to install new WebKit2GTK package with API version 4.1.
We will update Prerequisites in our site soon. But if you want to know how to install such version, here are some instructions from [wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry#linux):

```bash
# On Arch Linux / Manjaro:
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1
# On Debian / Ubuntu:
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev
# On Fedora:
sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1-devel
```

## Will this bring breaking changes to my code?

The main difference between version 4.0 and 4.1 are the soup library they use 4.0 uses soup2 and 4.1 uses soup3.
So if you didn't use any soup2 specific APIs, you applications should be fine.

The reason we want to make this change is because we aim to add flatpak support, but the WebKitGTK [Gnome runtime](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/available-runtimes.html#gnome) uses is webkit2gtk-4.1.
There are also some subtle bugs like [this](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/issues/717) only happen in soup2 and they can be fixed by upgrading to soup3.

## What else breaking changes we are going to expect?

The major one will be the MSRV. With Tauri v2.0-alpha.3 released, its MSRV is bumped to 1.64. We are also going to update windows-rs in the future.
But this rust version should satisfy latest version of windows-rs unless there is a newer version coming out.
We do plan to update our MSRV with minor release after 2.0. This could ease the tension to stick to any fixed rust version while updating dependencies.
