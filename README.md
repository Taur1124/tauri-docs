# Tauri Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) with [MeiliSearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/) for the docs indexation and is deployed by Netlify.

[![Deploys By Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/global/badges/netlify-light.svg)](https://www.netlify.com)

If you seek to change something from **our guides**, please refer to [the docs folder](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs/tree/dev/docs). \
When browsing the website, you will find edit links at the bottom of these docs.

The **API docs** are generated from our [Rust](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/core/tauri) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/tooling/api) source code.
