# Translations (i18n)

Thanks for your interest in helping to translate the documents! While we plan to support translations in the future, **we are not currently accepting them until Tauri 2.0 is a bit more stable**.

Once translations are enabled you can check the [translation status page](https://beta.tauri.app/contribute/translate-status).

To ensure the translation is consistent across multiple contributions, be sure to [communicate with others contributors in the `#docs` channel on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tauri) and consult with reliable external resources such as [Microsoft terminology search](https://msit.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODJmYjU4Y2YtM2M0ZC00YzYxLWE1YTktNzFjYmYxNTAxNjQ0IiwidCI6IjcyZjk4OGJmLTg2ZjEtNDFhZi05MWFiLTJkN2NkMDExZGI0NyIsImMiOjV9) during translation.

### Enabling a Language

If you seek to contribute but find your language missing, please open an issue.

### Starting a Translation

Before you start working on a translation, look through the [open pull requests](https://beta.tauri.app/contribute/translate-status#needs-review) to see if anyone else is already working on one for your language.

If none spotted, then now is time for you to lead the effort! So here's how to start:

1. Head to [translation status page](https://beta.tauri.app/contribute/translate-status).
2. Look for missing translation in corresponding languages.
3. Hit `Create page +` which will help you automagically fork the repository and create the corresponding page.
4. Once your translation is done, initiate a pull request.

Note that you may send send a pull request before your translation is complete: e.g., you may want to ask for help with translations. However, your pull request will not be merged until the translation is complete.

### Updating a Translation

#### Corrections

If you notice spelling or grammar errors, typos, or opportunities for better phrasing, open a pull request with your suggested fix. If you see a problem that you aren't sure of or don't have time to fix, open an issue.

#### Broken Links
When broken links are found, try to fix them across all translations. Ideally, only update the linked URLs, so that translation changes will definitely not be necessary.
