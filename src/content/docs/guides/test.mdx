## Unit testing

Unit testing allows you to write tests for very specific parts of your project, things like specific functions or classes.

### Frontend

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Mocha" description="Set up the mocha framework." />
</CardGrid>

### Backend

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Mocha" description="Set up the mocha framework." />
</CardGrid>

## Integration testing

Integration testing allows you to write tests that combine various specific parts of your project into something that's closer to what you would expect a user to develop using the public facing API's of your project.

### Frontend

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Mocha" description="Set up the mocha framework." />
</CardGrid>

### Backend

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Mocha" description="Set up the mocha framework." />
</CardGrid>

## End-to-end testing

Much like integration testing end-to-end (E2E) testing allows you to write tests based on the point of view of a user, but with E2E testing you go all the way to actually running your application and faking inputs in order to test it in real world situations.

### Frontend

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Mocha" description="Set up the mocha framework." />
</CardGrid>

### Backend

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Mocha" description="Set up the mocha framework." />
</CardGrid>

## Behavior testing

Behavioral driven development (BDD) is based on the idea of writing specifications for how an application or system should behave using plain English. Usually however you tend to use the syntax of a BDD framework which allows you not just to write such behaviors in a structured manner, but also to generate tests for them.

### Frontend

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Gherkin" description="Set up the Gherkin framework." />
</CardGrid>

### Backend

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Gherkin" description="Set up the Gherkin framework." />
</CardGrid>
