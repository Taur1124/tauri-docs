title: Building a Flatpak
---

{/* Maybe add some simple description of how flatpak works? */}

The process of creating a flatpack can be simplified considerably by creating a .deb beforehand.
This .deb is then included as a single file in the flatpack.
Since additional dependencies and libraries of your app have to be added manually to the manifest of a flatpack, we cannot provide a one-click builder.

The following information works for the standard tauri-app, which can be created with `cargo create-tauri-app`.
The Gnome 45 runtime includes all dependencies of the standard Tauri app with their correct versions.
Assume the flatpak manifest is in `/flatpak/org.your.id.yml` and the tauri project is in `/tauri-app`.


```yaml
id: org.your.id

runtime: org.gnome.Platform
runtime-version: "45"
sdk: org.gnome.Sdk

command: tauri-app
finish-args:
  - --socket=wayland        # Permission needed to show the window
  - --socket=fallback-x11   # Permission needed to show the window
  - --device=dri            # OpenGL, not necessary for all projects

modules:
  - name: binary
    buildsystem: simple
    sources:
      - type: file
        path: ../tauri-app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/tauri-app_0.1.0_amd64/data/usr/bin/tauri-app
        # This path points to the binary file which was created in the .deb bundle. Tauri also creates a folder which corresponds to the content of the unpacked .deb.
    build-commands:
      - "install -Dm755 tauri-app /app/bin/tauri-app"
```
