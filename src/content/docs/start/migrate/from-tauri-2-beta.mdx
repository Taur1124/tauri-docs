This guide walks you through upgrading your Tauri 2.0 beta application to Tauri 2.0 release candidate.

## Automated Migration

The Tauri v2 CLI includes a `migrate` command that automates most of the process and helps you finish the migration:

<CommandTabs
  npm="npm install @tauri-apps/cli@next
    npm run tauri migrate"
  yarn="yarn upgrade @tauri-apps/cli --next
    yarn tauri migrate"
  pnpm="pnpm update @tauri-apps/cli@next
    pnpm tauri migrate"
  cargo='cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0-rc"
    cargo tauri migrate'
/>

Learn more about the `migrate` command in the [Command Line Interface reference](/reference/cli/#migrate)

## Breaking Changes

We have had several breaking changes going from beta to release candidate. These can be either auto-migrated (see above) or manually performed.

### Tauri Core Plugins

We changed how Tauri built-in plugins are addressed in the capabilities [PR #10390](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/10390).

To migrate from the latest beta version you need to prepend all core permission identifiers in your capabilities with `core:` or switch to the `core:default` permission and remove old core plugin identifiers.

```json
...
"permissions": [
    "path:default",
    "event:default",
    "window:default",
    "app:default",
    "image:default",
    "resources:default",
    "menu:default",
    "tray:default",
]
...
```

```json
...
"permissions": [
    "core:path:default",
    "core:event:default",
    "core:window:default",
    "core:app:default",
    "core:image:default",
    "core:resources:default",
    "core:menu:default",
    "core:tray:default",
]
...
```

We also added a new special `core:default` permission set which will contain all default permissions of all core plugins, so you can simplify the permissions boilerplate in your capabilities config.

```json
...
"permissions": [
    "core:default"
]
...
```

### Built-In Development Server

We introduced changes to the network exposure of the built-in development server [PR #10437](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/10437).

By default the inbuilt dev server on desktop (e.g. `tauri dev`) now only exposes to the local system (`127.0.0.1`) and if you need to access the frontend from a remote machine you need to manually expose it. This can be achieved by adding the `--force-ip-prompt` flag where you are required to provide the desired IP-Address on every start of the dev server.

The built-in mobile development server also no longer exposes network wide and tunnels traffic from the local machine directly to the device.

If you develop with remote devices, where you need to access and expose to the devices in a local or remote network you can also use the `--force-ip-prompt` flag.
