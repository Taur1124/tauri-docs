One thing that makes Tauri so flexible is it's ability to work with virtually any frontend framework. We've created the [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app) utility to help you create a new Tauri project using one of the officially maintained framework templates.

`create-tauri-app` currently includes templates for vanilla (HTML, CSS and JavaScript without a framework), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Yew](https://yew.rs/), [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos), and [Sycamore](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/). You can also find or add your own community templates and frameworks in the [Awesome Tauri repo](https://github.com/tauri-apps/awesome-tauri).

Alternatively, you can [add Tauri to an existing project](/start/create-project) to quickly turn your existing codebase into a Tauri app.

## Using `create-tauri-app`

To get started using `create-tauri-app` run one of the below commands in the folder you'd like to setup your project. If you're not sure which command to use we recommend the Bash command on Linux and macOS and the PowerShell command on Windows.

Follow along with the prompts to choose your project name, frontend language, package manager, and frontend framework, and frontend framework options if applicable.

:::tip[Not sure what to choose?]

We recommend starting with the vanilla template (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a frontend framework) to get started. You can always [integrate a frontend framework](/start/create-project) later.

- Choose which language to use for your frontend: `TypeScript / JavaScript`
- Choose your package manager: `pnpm`
- Choose your UI template: `Vanilla`
- Choose your UI flavor: `TypeScript`

{ /* TODO: Can CTA offer to install the deps? */}

After `create-tauri-app` has complete you can navigate into your project's folder, install dependencies, then use the [Tauri CLI](/reference/cli) to start the development server:

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

<CommandTabs
            npm="cd my-tauri-app
    npm install
    npm run tauri dev"
            yarn="cd my-tauri-app
    yarn install
    yarn tauri dev"
            pnpm="cd my-tauri-app
    pnpm install
    pnpm tauri dev"
            cargo="cd my-tauri-app
    cargo tauri dev"
/>

You'll now see a new window open with your app running.

**Congratulations!** You've made your Tauri app! ðŸš€

## Manual Setup (Tauri CLI)

If you already have an existing frontend or prefer to set it up yourself, you can use the Tauri CLI to initialize the backend for your project separately.

:::note
The following example assumes you are creating a new project. If you've already initialized the frontend of your application, you can skip to step 4.
:::

<Steps>

    1. First, install Tauri's CLI tool globally using your package manager of choice:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli"
            yarn="yarn global add @tauri-apps/cli"
            pnpm="pnpm add -g @tauri-apps/cli"
            cargo="cargo install tauri-cli"
        />

    2. Create a new directory for your project and initialize the frontend. You can use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or any framework you prefer such as Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte, Yew, or Leptos. You just need a way of serving the app in your browser. Just as an example, this is how you would setup a simple Vite app:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="mkdir my-tauri-app
                cd my-tauri-app
                npm create vite@latest ."
            yarn="mkdir my-tauri-app
                cd my-tauri-app
                yarn create vite ."
            pnpm="mkdir my-tauri-app
                cd my-tauri-app
                pnpm create vite ."
        />

    3. Determine the URL of your frontend development server. This is the URL that Tauri will use to load your content. For example, if you are using Vite, the default URL is `http://localhost:5173`.

    4. In your project directory, initialize Tauri:

        ```bash
        tauri init
        ```

        After running the command it will display a prompt asking you for different options.
        Here is an example:

        ```bash
        âœ” What is your app name? my-tauri-app
        âœ” What should the window title be? my-tauri-app
        âœ” Where are your web assets (HTML/CSS/JS) located, relative to the "<current dir>/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json" file that will be created? ..
        âœ” What is the url of your dev server? http://localhost:5173
        âœ” What is your frontend dev command? pnpm run dev
        âœ” What is your frontend build command? pnpm run build
        ```

        :::note
        It's important to make sure that the dev server port is correct. For example, while Vite uses 5173, not every framework uses the same port. Tauri needs to know the correct port to load your content.

        Tauri will run the configured dev command when you run `tauri dev` and the build command when you run `tauri build`.
        :::

        This will create a `src-tauri` directory in your project with the necessary Tauri configuration files.

    5. Develop your frontend application as you would normally. Tauri acts as a backend, so it's up to you how much you focus on the Rust side of the code. In many cases, your main focus can be on the web technologies.

    6. Edit `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to configure Tauri. You can set application window size, permissions, and other settings here. You can also change the dev commands and URL here if needed.

    7. Verify your Tauri app is working by running the development server:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="npm run tauri dev"
            yarn="yarn tauri dev"
            pnpm="pnpm tauri dev"
            cargo="cargo tauri dev"
        />

        This command will compile the Rust code and open a window with your web content.

</Steps>

**Congratulations!** You've created a new Tauri project using the Tauri CLI! ðŸš€
