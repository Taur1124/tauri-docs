Tauri is frontend agnostic and supports most frontend frameworks out of the box. However, sometimes a framework need a bit of extra configuration to integrate with Tauri. Below is a list of frameworks with recommended configurations.

If a framework is not listed then it may work with Tauri with no additional configuration needed or it could have not been documented yet. Any contributions to add a framework that may require additional configuration are welcome to help others in the Tauri community.

:::tip[Framework Not Listed?]

Don't see a framework listed? It may work with Tauri without any additional configuration required. Read the [configuration checklist](/start/frontend-configuration/#configuration-checklist) for any common configurations to check for.

## Configuration Checklist

Conceptually Tauri acts as a static web host. You need to provide Tauri with a folder containing some mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript and possibly WASM that can be served to the webview Tauri provides.

Below is a checklist of common scenarios needed to integrate a frontend with Tauri:

{/* TODO: Link to core concept of SSG/SSR, etc. */}
{/* TODO: Link to mobile development server guide */}
{/* TODO: Concept of how to do a client-server relationship? */}

- Use static site generation (SSG). Tauri doesn't officially support server based alternatives (such as SSR).
- For mobile development, a development server of some kind is necessary that can host the frontend on your internal IP.
- Use a proper client-server relationship between your app and your API's (no hybrid solutions with SSR).
