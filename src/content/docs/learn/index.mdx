## Create lab apps

Each lab assumes you've created a fresh new app for each of them. That doesn't necessarily have to be
the case, you can certainly experiment using your own app, or using different options than what the
lab assumes, but we strongly recommend you set up a new app for each lab so that it becomes as easy
as possible to follow along.

```sh
# Create a new app using CTA
npx create-tauri-app --beta --mobile
# Spam hit "Enter" to get all defaults
```
