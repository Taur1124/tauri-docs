title: Capabilities
---

Tauri provides application and plugin developers with a capabilities system,
to granually enable and constrain the core exposure to the application frontend running in the
system WebView.

Capabilities are a set of [permissions](/concepts/security/permissions) mapped to application windows by window label,
where permissions are descriptions of explicit privileges or enablement of commands.
Permissions can define the [scope](/concepts/security/scope) of commands, which is used for granular access controls.

This can be configured in the `capabilities` section of the Tauri [configuration](/references/configuration-files#tauri-config).
For a full reference of the configuration scheme please see the [references](/references/v2/config) section.

*What does it protect against?*

Depending on the permissions and capabilities it is able to:

- Minimize impact of frontend compromise
- Prevent or reduce (accidential) exposure of local system interfaces and data
- Prevent or reduce possible privilege escalation from frontend to backend/system

*What does it **not** protect against?*

- Malicious or insecure Rust code
- Too lax scopes and configuration
- Incorrect scope checks in the command implementation
- Intentional bypasses from Rust code
- Basically anything which was written in the rust core of an application
- 0-days or unpatched 1-days in the system WebView
- Supply chain attacks or otherwise compromised developer systems

:::caution

The security boundaries are depending on window labels (__not titles__).
We recommend to only allow exposure of the window creation functionality to higher privileged windows.

## Example

```json
"capabilities":[
    {
        // Identifer which needs to be unique
        "identifier": "my-capability",
        // Description of the capability
        "description": "The default application capability used for all windows",
        // Context where the windows are used.
        // Can be used for dangerous remote origins to allow
        // remote hosted websites to facilitate the commands.
        "context": "local",
        // The `*` matches all windows
        "windows": [ "*" ],
        // List of permissions attached to this capability
        // The `fs:` namespace indicates the used permission
        // is provided from the filesystem plugin.
        "permissions": [
            "fs:default",
            "allow-home-read-extended"
           ]
    },
]
        
```
