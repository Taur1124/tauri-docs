title: Threats and Best Practices
---

Application development environment security is critical for every project,
as all fancy and advanced runtime or compliation based security measures
can be potentially rendered useless, once a development system is compromised.

Therefore we analysed several threats you should be aware when developing
a Tauri application and provide you with additional best practices to reduce risk or
impact of compromise.

## Threat Model

Tauri applications are composed of many pieces at different points of the lifecycle.
Here we describe classical threats and what you SHOULD do about them.

### Upstream Threats

Tauri is a direct dependency on your project, and we maintain strict authorial control
of commits, reviews, pull requests, and releases.
We do our best to maintain up-to-date dependencies and take action to either update
or fork and fix. Other projects may not be so well maintained, and may not even
have ever been audited.

Please consider their health when integrating them, otherwise, you may have adopted
architectural debt without even knowing it.

### Development Threats

We assume that you, the developer, care for your development environment.
It is on you to make sure that your operating system, build toolchains, and
associated dependencies are kept up to date.

A genuine risk all of us face is what is known as "supply-chain attacks",
which are usually considered to be attacks on direct dependencies of your project.
However, a growing class of attacks in the wild directly target development machines,
and you would be well off to address this head-on.

One practice that we highly recommend, is to only ever consume critical dependencies
from git using hash revisions at best or named tags as second best.
This holds for Rust as well as the Node ecosystem.
Also, consider requiring all contributors to sign their commits and protect Git branches and pipelines.

### Buildtime Threats

Modern organizations use CI/CD to manufacture binary artifacts.
At Tauri, we even provide a GitHub Workflow for building on multiple platforms.
If you create your own CI/CD and depend on third-party tooling, be wary of actions
whose versions you have not explicitly pinned.

You should sign your binaries for the platform you are shipping to.
While this can be complicated and somewhat costly to set up, end users expect that your
app is verifiably from you.

### Runtime Threats

We assume the webview is insecure, which has led Tauri to implement several protections
regarding webview access to system APIs in the context of loading untrusted userland content.

Using the [Content Security Policy](@concepts/security/csp.mdx) will lockdown types of
communication that the Webview can undertake.
Furthermore, [Capabilities](@concepts/security/capabilities.mdx) can prevent untrusted content or scripts from accessing
the API within the Webview.

And please, whatever you do, **DO NOT** trust the results of cryptography using private keys in the Webview.
Rust is there for a reason.

### Updater Threats

We have done our best to make shipping hot updates to the app as straightforward and secure as possible.
However, all bets are off if you lose control of the manifest server,
the build server, or the binary hosting service. If you build your own system,
consult a professional OPS architect and build it properly.

## Best Practices

### Keep Your Application Up-To-Date

When releasing your app into the wild, you are also shipping a bundle that has Tauri in it.
Vulnerabilities affecting Tauri may impact the security of your application.
By updating Tauri to the latest version, you ensure that critical vulnerabilities
are already patched and cannot be exploited in your application.
Also be sure to keep your compiler (rustc) and transpilers (nodejs) up to date,
because there are often security issues that are resolved.

### Evaluate Your Dependencies

While npm and Crates.io provide many convenient packages,
it is your responsibility to choose trustworthy third-party libraries - or
rewrite them in Rust. If you do use outdated libraries which are affected by
known vulnerabilities or are unmaintained, your application security and good
night's sleep could be in jeopardy. 

Use tooling like `npm audit` and `cargo audit` to automate this process,
and lean on the security community's important work.

Recent trends in the rust ecosystem like `cargo vet` or `cargo crev` can
help to further evaluate dependencies and can reduce likelihood of supply chain attacks.

### Adopt More Secure Coding Practices

The first line of defense for your application is your own code.
Although Tauri can protect you from common web vulnerabilities,
such as Cross-Site Scripting based Remote Code Execution,
improper configurations can have a security impact.
Even if this were not the case, it is highly recommended to
adopt secure software development best practices and perform security testing.

### Educate Your Users

True security means that unexpected behavior cannot happen.
So in a sense, being more secure means having the peace of mind
of knowing that ONLY those things that you want to happen can happen.
In the real world, though, this is a utopian "dream".
However, by removing as many vectors as possible and building on
a solid foundation, your choice of Tauri is a signal to your users
that you care about them, their safety, and their devices.
