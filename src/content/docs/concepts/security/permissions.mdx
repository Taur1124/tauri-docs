title: Permissions
---

Permissions are descriptions of explicit privileges of commands.

It can enable commands to be accessible in the frontend of a Tauri application.
It maps scopes to commands and defines which commands are enabled.
Permissions can enable or deny certain commands, define scopes or combine both.

Permissions can be grouped as a set under a new identifier.
This is called a permission set.

As a plugin developer you can ship multiple, pre-defined, well named permissions
for all of your exposed commands.

## Permission Identifier

The permissions identifier is used to ensure that permissions can be re-used and have unique names.

:::tip 
With **crate-name** we refer to the plugin crate name or tauri application slug.
This is meant as namespacing to reduce likelihood of naming conflicts. 
:::

- `<crate-name>:default` Indicates the permission is the default for a plugin or application
- `<crate-name>:default-<command-name>` Indicates the permission is the default for an individual command

The plugin prefix `tauri-plugin-` will be automatically appended to the identifier at compile time and is not required
to be manually specified.

Identifiers are limited to ASCII lower case alphabetic characters `[a-z]` and the maximum length 
of the identifier is currently limited to `116` due to the following constants:

```rust
const IDENTIFIER_SEPARATOR: u8 = b':';
const PLUGIN_PREFIX: &str = "tauri-plugin-";

// https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-name-field
const MAX_LEN_PREFIX: usize = 64 - PLUGIN_PREFIX.len();
const MAX_LEN_BASE: usize = 64;
const MAX_LEN_IDENTIFIER: usize = MAX_LEN_PREFIX + 1 + MAX_LEN_BASE;
```

## Permission Set

A special form of a permission is a permission set.


## Examples 

Example permissions from the `File System` plugin.

```toml
[[permission]]
identifier = "scope-home"
description = """This scope permits access to all files and
list content of top level directories in the `$HOME`folder."""

[[scope.allow]]
path = "$HOME/*"

[[permission]]
identifier = "read-files"
description = """This enables all file read related
commands without any pre-configured accessible paths."""
commands.allow = [
    "read_file",
    "read",
    "open",
    "read_text_file",
    "read_text_file_lines",
    "read_text_file_lines_next"
]
```

As an application developer you can extend existing plugin permissions or
define them for your own commands.

Example implementation extending above permissions:

```toml
[[permission]]
identifier = "allow-mkdir"
description = "This enables the mkdir command."
commands.allow = [
    "mkdir"
]

[[set]]
identifier = "allow-home-read-extended"
description = """ This allows non-recursive read access to files
in the `$HOME` folder. Extends existing permissions to also
enable the `mkdir` command.
"""
permissions = [
    "fs:read-files",
    "fs:scope-home",
    "mkdir"
]
```

:::note

As an application developer the configuration files can be written in `json`/`json5` or `toml`,
whereas plugin developers only can use `toml`.
