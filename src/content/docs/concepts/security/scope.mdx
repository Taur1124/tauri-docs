title: Command Scopes
---

A scope is a granular way to define (dis)allowed behavior of a Tauri command.

Scopes are categorized into `allow` or `deny` scopes, where `deny` always
superseeds the `allow` scope.

The scope type needs be of any serde serializable type.

The scope is passed to the command and handling or properly enforcing is implemented
by the command itself.

:::caution

Command developers need to ensure that there are no scope bypasses possible.
The scope validation implementation should be audited to ensure correctness.

:::

## Examples

These examples are taken from the `Fs` plugin permissions:

```toml
[[scope.allow]]
path = "$APPLOCALDATA/**"
```

```toml
[[scope.deny]]
path = "$APPLOCALDATA/EBWebView/**"
```
