This page seeks to explain the high-level concepts and security features
at the core of Tauri's design and ecosystem that make you, your apps, and your users safer by default.

It also contains advice for best practices, how to disclose vulnerabilities to us
and references to in-detail concept explanations.

:::note

It is important to remember that the security of your Tauri application is the sum of the overall security
of Tauri itself, all Rust and npm dependencies, your code, and the devices that run the final application.
The Tauri Team does their best to do their part,
the security community does its part, and you too should follow a few important best practices.

## Security Boundaries

Tauri's security model differentiates between rust code written for the application's
core and frontend code written in any framework or language understood by the system
WebView.

The IPC layer is the bridge for communication between these two trust groups and ensures
that boundaries are not broken.


![IPC Diagram](@assets/concepts/security-boundaries.svg)

Any code executed by the plugins or the application core has full
access to all available system resources and is not constrained.

Any code executed in the WebView has only access to system resources
via the well defined [IPC](/concepts/inter-process-communication) layer. The access of application core commands is configured
and constrained via capabilities defined in the application configuration.
The individual command implementations enforce the optional fine grained access level,
which are also defined in the capabilities configuration.

enforcement:

Tauri allows developers to choose their own frontend stack and framework.
This means we can not provide you with a hardening guide for every frontend stack
of choice, but Tauri offers generic features to control and contain attack surface.

We are always striving to improve and already have several topics of interest
we are considering as [future work](/concepts/security/future).

## Coordinated Disclosure

If you feel that there is a security concern or issue with anything in Tauri
or other repositories in our organization, __please do not publicly comment on your findings__.
Instead, reach out directly to our security team.

The preferred disclosure method is via [Github Vulnerability Disclosure](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
on the affected repository.
Most of our repositories have this feature enabled but if in doubt please submit via the [Tauri repository](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/new).

Alternatively you can contact us via email at: [security@tauri.app](mailto:security@tauri.app).

Although we do not currently have a budget for Security Bounties,
in some cases, we will consider rewarding coordinated disclosure with our limited resources.
