### Basic Cross Platform Compilation

```yaml
name: 'publish'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

jobs:
  publish-tauri:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        settings:
          - platform: 'macos-latest' # for Arm based macs (M1 and above).
            args: '--target aarch64-apple-darwin'
          - platform: 'macos-latest' # for Intel based macs.
            args: '--target x86_64-apple-darwin'
          - platform: 'ubuntu-22.04' # for Tauri v1 you could replace this with ubuntu-20.04.
            args: ''
          - platform: 'windows-latest'
            args: ''

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.settings.platform }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: install dependencies (ubuntu only)
        if: matrix.settings.platform == 'ubuntu-22.04' # This must match the platform value defined above.
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf
        # webkitgtk 4.0 is for Tauri v1 - webkitgtk 4.1 is for Tauri v2.
        # You can remove the one that doesn't apply to your app to speed up the workflow a bit.

      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: lts/*
          cache: 'yarn' # Set this to npm, yarn or pnpm.

      - name: install Rust stable
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable # Set this to dtolnay/rust-toolchain@nightly
        with:
          # Those targets are only used on macos runners so it's in an `if` to slightly speed up windows and linux builds.
          targets: ${{ matrix.settings.platform == 'macos-latest' && 'aarch64-apple-darwin,x86_64-apple-darwin' || '' }}

      - name: Rust cache
        uses: swatinem/rust-cache@v2
        with:
          workspaces: './src-tauri -> target'

      - name: install frontend dependencies
        # If you don't have `beforeBuildCommand` configured you may want to build your frontend here too.
        run: yarn install # change this to npm or pnpm depending on which one you use.

      - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tagName: app-v__VERSION__ # the action automatically replaces \_\_VERSION\_\_ with the app version.
          releaseName: 'App v__VERSION__'
          releaseBody: 'See the assets to download this version and install.'
          releaseDraft: true
          prerelease: false
          args: ${{ matrix.settings.args }}
```

### Arm Runner Compilation
The process in which you cross compile is quite similar to version 1, however one small change is
that the base_image uses `Bookworm` instead of `Bullseye`

In order to compile from source you must install nodejs from a snap as the debian version is too old to be used.
```yaml
name: Raspberry Pi compile
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pguyot/arm-runner-action@v2.5.2
        with:
          base_image: https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/DietPi_RPi-ARMv8-Bookworm.img.xz
          cpu: cortex-a53
          bind_mount_repository: true
          image_additional_mb: 10240
          optimize_image: false
          commands: |
            # Rust complains (rightly) that $HOME doesn't match eid home
            export HOME=/root
            # Workaround to CI worker being stuck on Updating crates.io index
            export CARGO_REGISTRIES_CRATES_IO_PROTOCOL=sparse
            # Install setup prerequisites
            apt-get update -y --allow-releaseinfo-change
            apt-get upgrade -y
            apt-get autoremove -y
            apt-get install curl
            curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
            . "$HOME/.cargo/env"
            curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash
            # Install framework specific packages
            apt-get install -y snap
            sudo snap install node --channel=20/stable --classic
            npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest
            # Install build tools and tauri-cli requirements
            apt-get install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential wget libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
            # Install frontend dependencies
            npm install
            # Build the application
            npm run tauri build
      - name: Upload deb bundle
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: Debian Bundle
          path: ${{ github.workspace }}src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/tauri_1.4_arm64.deb
```
### Cross Compiling with self hosted runners
Cross Compiling with self hosted runners is by far the simplest method for compiling for aarch64. You simply have to update the platform in matrix settings
Before you must install an action-runner for each platform option you wish to support by following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)

````yaml
- platform: 'ARM64'
  args: ''
- platform: 'ARM'
  args: ''
````
