### Basic Cross Platform Compilation

```yaml
name: 'publish'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

jobs:
  publish-tauri:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        settings:
          - platform: 'macos-latest' # for Arm based macs (M1 and above).
            args: '--target aarch64-apple-darwin'
          - platform: 'macos-latest' # for Intel based macs.
            args: '--target x86_64-apple-darwin'
          - platform: 'ubuntu-22.04' # for Tauri v1 you could replace this with ubuntu-20.04.
            args: ''
          - platform: 'windows-latest'
            args: ''

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.settings.platform }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: install dependencies (ubuntu only)
        if: matrix.settings.platform == 'ubuntu-22.04' # This must match the platform value defined above.
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf
        # webkitgtk 4.0 is for Tauri v1 - webkitgtk 4.1 is for Tauri v2.
        # You can remove the one that doesn't apply to your app to speed up the workflow a bit.

      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: lts/*
          cache: 'yarn' # Set this to npm, yarn or pnpm.

      - name: install Rust stable
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable # Set this to dtolnay/rust-toolchain@nightly
        with:
          # Those targets are only used on macos runners so it's in an `if` to slightly speed up windows and linux builds.
          targets: ${{ matrix.settings.platform == 'macos-latest' && 'aarch64-apple-darwin,x86_64-apple-darwin' || '' }}

      - name: Rust cache
        uses: swatinem/rust-cache@v2
        with:
          workspaces: './src-tauri -> target'

      - name: install frontend dependencies
        # If you don't have `beforeBuildCommand` configured you may want to build your frontend here too.
        run: yarn install # change this to npm or pnpm depending on which one you use.

      - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tagName: app-v__VERSION__ # the action automatically replaces \_\_VERSION\_\_ with the app version.
          releaseName: 'App v__VERSION__'
          releaseBody: 'See the assets to download this version and install.'
          releaseDraft: true
          prerelease: false
          args: ${{ matrix.settings.args }}
```

### Arm Runner Compilation
The process in which you cross compile is quite similar to version 1, however one small change is
that the base_image uses `Bookworm` instead of `Bullseye`. It is important to note that the `VERSION` variable must be adjusted to your version in `tauri.conf.json` each time you update.

```yaml
name: Raspberry Pi compile
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
env:
    VERSION: 2.0.5
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        arch: [aarch64, armv7l]
        include:
        - arch: aarch64
          cpu: cortex-a72
          base_image: https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/DietPi_RPi-ARMv8-Bookworm.img.xz
          deb: arm64
          other: aarch64
        - arch: armv7l
          cpu: cortex-a53
          deb: armhf
          other: arm
          base_image: https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/DietPi_RPi-ARMv7-Bookworm.img.xz
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pguyot/arm-runner-action@v2.5.2
        with:
          base_image: ${{ matrix.base_image }}
          cpu: ${{ matrix.cpu }}
          bind_mount_repository: true
          image_additional_mb: 10240
