## Framework Configuration

Tauri is frontend agnostic, but sometimes frameworks need a bit of extra attention for them to integrate
nicely with Tauri. The frameworks listed below are by no means a list of officially supported frameworks,
if your framework isn't listed it can most likely be made to work with Tauri as well.
