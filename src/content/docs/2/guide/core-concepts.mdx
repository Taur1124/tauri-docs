As you embark on your journey with Tauri, having a working knowledge of the concepts covered on this page will help you to get the most out of the framework.

## Single Page Applications (SPAs)

Single Page Applications, often referred to as SPAs, load a single HTML page and dynamically update its content using Javascript as users interact with it. This is commonly achieved using frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular, which handle rendering and navigation. SPAs provide a smooth user experience by reducing page reloads and enhancing responsiveness.

## Static Site Generators (SSGs)

Static Site Generators are tools that enable developers to create websites with pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. SSGs generate static files during the build process, which can then be hosted on a web server. Popular SSGs include Eleventy, Jekyll, and Hugo, which streamline the process of creating and maintaining static websites.
