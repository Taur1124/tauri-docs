import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Learn more about Trunk at https://trunkrs.dev. This guide is accurate as of Trunk 0.17.5.

## Checklist

- Use SSG, Tauri doesn't officially support server based solutions.
- Use `0.0.0.0` so that your device can detect your frontend.
- Use the fork of Trunk made by one of the Tauri core member which contains a couple of fixes to it. Hopefully we can get these merged upstream eventually.
