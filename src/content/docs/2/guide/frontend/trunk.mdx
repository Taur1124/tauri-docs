Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Learn more about Trunk at https://trunkrs.dev. This guide is accurate as of Trunk 0.17.5.

:::caution[Note on Mobile Support]

Tauri mobile development is not currently possible with Trunk. If developing for mobile you will need to use https://github.com/amrbashir/trunk until https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/pull/494 and https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/pull/500 are merged and released.

You will need to use `cargo install --git https://github.com/amrbashir/trunk` or `cargo binstall --git https://github.com/amrbashir/trunk` when installing Trunk and then set `serve.ws_protocol = "ws"` in `Trunk.toml`.

:::

## Checklist

- Use SSG, Tauri doesn't officially support server based solutions.
- Use `address = "0.0.0.0"` so that the webserver is available on the network for mobile development.
