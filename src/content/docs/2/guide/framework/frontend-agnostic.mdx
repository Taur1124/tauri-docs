title: Frontend agnostic

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Tauri has no opinion on what frontend framework you pick or what languages you use. However, that doesn't mean that
Tauri doesn't have any demands on it.

Within web development the concept of frontend agnosticism is more commonly referred to as static web hosting. That is,
you compile your website once and can then put it into any http framework capable of serving a folder. Examples of this
is for example Apache and Nginx.

For all intents and purposes you can think of Tauri as a static web host, and you have to provide Tauri with a folder
containing some mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript and possibly WASM that can be served to the webview Tauri provides.

## Checklist

- Use static site generation (SSG). Tauri doesn't officially support any server based alternatives (SSR).
- For mobile development a development server of some kind is necessary that can host the frontend on your internal IP.
- Use a proper client-server relationship between your app and your API's. So no hybrid solutions with SSR.
