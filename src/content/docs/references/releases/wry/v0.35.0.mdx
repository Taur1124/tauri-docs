- [`e61e7f8`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/commit/e61e7f8474c18752f5c60d3f1f5ba33b27e41d52)([#1090](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/1090)) **Breaking change** Consistently use `WebView` in API names. The following APIs were renamed:

  - `WebviewExtWindows` → `WebViewExtWindows`
  - `WebviewExtUnix` → `WebViewExtUnix`
  - `WebviewExtMacOS` → `WebViewExtMacOS`
  - `WebviewExtIOS` → `WebViewExtIOS`
  - `WebviewExtAndroid` → `WebViewExtAndroid`
  - `WebviewUriLoader` → `WebViewUriLoader`
- [`e61e7f8`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/commit/e61e7f8474c18752f5c60d3f1f5ba33b27e41d52)([#1090](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/1090)) Add `WebViewExtWindows::set_memory_usage_level` API to set the [memory usage target level](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.web.webview2.core.corewebview2memoryusagetargetlevel) on Windows. Setting &#39;Low&#39; memory usage target level when an application is going to inactive can significantly reduce the memory consumption. Please read the [guide for WebView2](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/blob/main/specs/MemoryUsageTargetLevel.md) for more details.

  - `application` module is removed, and `webivew` module is moved to root module.
  - `WebViewBuilder::new`, `WebView::new` now take `RawWindowHandle` instead.
  - Add `WebViewBuilder::new_as_child`, `WebView::new_as_child` to crate a webview as a child inside a parent window.
  - `Webview::inner_size` is removed.
  - Add `WebViewBuilderExtUnix` trait to extend `WebViewBuilder` on Unix platforms.
  - Add `new_gtk` functions to `WebViewBuilderExtUnix` and `WebviewExtUnix`.
  - [raw-window-handle](https://docs.rs/raw-window-handle/latest/raw_window_handle/) crate is re-exported as `wry::raw_window_handle`.

  This also means that we removed `tao` as a dependency completely which required some changes to the public APIs and to the Android backend:

  - Webview attributes `ipc_handler`, `file_drop_handler`, `document_change_handler` don&#39;t take the `Window` as first parameter anymore.
    Users should use closure to capture the types they want to use.
  - Position field in `FileDrop` event is now a tuple of `(x, y)` physical position instead of `PhysicalPosition`. Users need to handle scale factor
  - We exposed the `android_setup` function that needs to be called once to setup necessary logic.
  - Previously the `android_binding!` had internal call to `tao::android_binding` but now that `tao` has been removed,
    the macro signature has changed and you now need to call `tao::android_binding` yourself, checkout the crate documentation for more information.
