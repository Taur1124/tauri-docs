- Add option to enable/disable zoom shortcuts for WebView2, disabled by default.
  - [494a110](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/commit/494a11057f9ddd2bf4bcecdc96b43ed95c5bd08e) WebView2: Enable/disable platform default zooming shortcuts, closes [#569](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/569) ([#574](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/574)) on 2022-05-15
- Prevent memory leak on macOS.
  - [16d1924](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/commit/16d192450ed639f94cf8b7137fa5fea1a319f8b5) fix: prevent memory leak on macOS, closes [#536](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/536) ([#587](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/pull/587)) on 2022-05-20
- Update the `windows` crate to the latest 0.37.0 release and `webview2-com` to 0.16.0 to match.

The `#[implement]` macro in `windows-implement` and the `implement` feature in `windows` depend on some `const` generic features which stabilized in `rustc` 1.61. The MSRV on Windows targets is effectively 1.61, but other targets do not require these features.

The `webview2-com` crate specifies `rust-version = &quot;1.61&quot;`, so `wry` will inherit that MSRV and developers on Windows should get a clear error message telling them to update their toolchain when building `wry` or anything that depends on `wry`. Developers targeting other platforms should be able to continue using whatever toolchain they were using before.
