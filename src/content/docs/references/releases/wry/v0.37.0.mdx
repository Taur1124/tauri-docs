- [`8c86fba`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/commit/8c86fbaf51cd970737cc070583318d4b532349d2) **Breaking change**: Removed `data:` url support, as its native support in Windows and macOS are buggy and unreliable, use `Webview::with_html` instead.
- [`8c86fba`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/commit/8c86fbaf51cd970737cc070583318d4b532349d2) On Linux, decode `FilDropEvent` paths before emitting them to make it consistent across all platforms.
- [`8c86fba`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/commit/8c86fbaf51cd970737cc070583318d4b532349d2) Added `WebViewExtMacOS::reparent`,`WebViewExtWindows::reparent` and `WebViewExtUnix::reparent`.
- [`8c86fba`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/commit/8c86fbaf51cd970737cc070583318d4b532349d2) Revert global keys shortcuts (wry#1156)
- [`8c86fba`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/commit/8c86fbaf51cd970737cc070583318d4b532349d2) **Breaking change**: Removed internal url parsing which had a few side-effects such as encoded url content, now it is up to the user to pass a valid URL as a string. This also came with a few breaking changes:

  - Removed `Url` struct re-export
  - Removed `Error::UrlError` variant.
  - Changed `WebviewAttributes::url` field type to `String`.
  - Changed `WebviewBuilder::with_url` and `WebviewBuilder::with_url_and_headers` return type to `WebviewBuilder` instead of `Result&lt;WebviewBuilder&gt;`.
  - Changed `Webview::url` getter to return a `String` instead of `Url`.
