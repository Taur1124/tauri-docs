- Prevent &quot;once&quot; events from being able to be called multiple times.

- `Window::trigger(/*...*/)` is now properly `pub` instead of `pub(crate)`.

- `Manager::once_global(/*...*/)` now returns an `EventHandler`.

- `Window::once(/*...*/)` now returns an `EventHandler`.

- (internal) `event::Listeners::trigger(/*...*/)` now handles removing &quot;once&quot; events.

- [ece243d](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/ece243d17c9c3ef8d2ba8e3b25b872aa6ea0b6ab) don&#39;t remove once listener on new thread ([#1506](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/1506)) on 2021-04-14

- Window and global events can now be nested inside event handlers. They will run as soon
  as the event handler closure is finished in the order they were called. Previously, calling
  events inside an event handler would produce a deadlock.

Note: The order that event handlers are called when triggered is still non-deterministic.

- [e447b8e](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/e447b8e0e6198c8972bae25625bb409850cb686b) allow event listeners to be nested ([#1513](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/1513)) on 2021-04-15
