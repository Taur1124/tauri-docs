### New Features

- [`6e488378`](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/6e48837860203582d2ef8e59d4524f98511a14c0)([#8474](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/8474)) Re-export `Url` type.

### Enhancements

- [`8ce51cec`](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/8ce51cec3baf4ed88d80c59bf3bbe96fd369c7a0)([#7718](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7718)) On Windows, retain command line args when relaunching the app after an update. Supports NSIS and WiX (without elevated update task).

### Bug Fixes

- [`cc3d8e77`](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/cc3d8e77313672f25520e278bbe8fae1b275a735)([#8539](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/8539)) Fixes a deadlock when reading a stdout or stderr line returns an error.
- [`b546b42d`](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/b546b42db7e75a59232367dd6212fe3b75bb4c6d)([#8577](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/8577)) Preserve the order of JS object/map keys in IPC calls. This also fixes issues with the JS `http` module when calling to servers that required a specific order of `FormBody` contents.
- [`8f8729d9`](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/8f8729d91843acd2bd2a24731db865d690dd9ab1)([#8312](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/8312)) On macOS, allow cancelling maximization when doubleclick happens on `data-tauri-drag-region` by simply keeping the left moust button pressed and then moving the mouse away of the starting position of the click, which is consistent with the native behavior of macOS.

### Dependencies

- Upgraded to `tauri-runtime-wry@0.14.4`
