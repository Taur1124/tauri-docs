- The execute_promise and execute_promise_sync helpers now accepts any tauri::Result&lt;T&gt; where T: impl Serialize.
  This means that you do not need to serialize your response manually or deal with String quotes anymore.
  As part of this refactor, the event::emit function also supports impl Serialize instead of String.
