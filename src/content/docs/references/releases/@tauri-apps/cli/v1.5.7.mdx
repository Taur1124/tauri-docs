- [`1d5aa38a`](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/1d5aa38ae418ea31f593590b6d32cf04d3bfd8c1)([#8162](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/8162)) Fixes errors on command output, occuring when the output stream contains an invalid UTF-8 character, or ends with a multi-bytes UTF-8 character.
- [`f26d9f08`](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/f26d9f0884f63f61b9f4d4fac15e6b251163793e)([#8263](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/8263)) Fixes an issue in the NSIS installer which caused the uninstallation to leave empty folders on the system if the `resources` feature was used.
