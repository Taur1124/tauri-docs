Plugin to ensure that a single instance of your tauri app is running at a time.


## Install

_This plugin requires a Rust version of at least **1.75**_

You can install the Core plugin by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="crates.io">
```toml title="src-tauri/Cargo.toml" ins={2}
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-single-instance = "2.0.0-beta"
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Git">

```toml title="src-tauri/Cargo.toml" ins={2}
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-single-instance = { git = "https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace", branch = "v2" }
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

To use this plugin, you need to register the core plugin with Tauri. The plugin init() method takes a closure that is called when a new app instance was started, but closed by the plugin. The closure has three arguments: the AppHandle, the list of arguments (important for instance on deep link usage) and the current working directory:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/main.rs" ins={3}
fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_single_instance::init(|app, args, cwd| {}))
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

### Focusing on New Instance

By default nothing happens when you start a new instance and the application is already running. To focus the window of the running instance when user tries to open a new instance, change the callback closure:


```rust title="src-tauri/src/main.rs" {1} {5-7} {12-21}
use tauri::{AppHandle, Manager};

fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_single_instance::init(|app, args, cwd| {
            let _ = show_window(app);
        }))
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}

fn show_window(app: &AppHandle) {
    let windows = app.webview_windows();

    windows
        .values()
        .next()
        .expect("Sorry, no window found")
        .set_focus()
        .expect("Can't Bring Window to Focus");
}
```
