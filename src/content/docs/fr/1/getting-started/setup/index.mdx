# Quick Start

Tauri is compatible with **almost every frontend stack**. Select yours and get started!

<Callout kind="tip" title="create-tauri-app">

The easiest way to scaffold a new project is the [`create-tauri-app`] utility. It provides opinionated templates for vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and many frontend frameworks like React, Svelte, and Yew.

Note that you do not need to follow the below guides if you use `create-tauri-app`, but we still recommend reading one (such as the [HTML/CSS/JavaScript] guide) to understand the setup.

If you're unfamiliar with web development or have no favorite frontend stack you might find the [HTML/CSS/JavaScript] guide the most helpful. It guides you through getting started with the most minimal frontend setup possible using either Node or Cargo.
