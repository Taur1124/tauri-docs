# Tauri Governance

One of the main goals of the organizational structure of Tauri is to guarantee we stay true to our open source values and do so sustainably while respecting the health and well-being of contributors. [The Tauri Programme within the Commons Conservancy](https://dracc.commonsconservancy.org/0035/) was established to commit to those values, and facilitate an open, transparent and efficient governance process throughout the future development of the Tauri and its auxiliary materials.

## Tauri Working Group

The Tauri Working Group is the collective framework created to enable this governance process. It's composed of the following components:

- Working Group Members
- Tauri Board & Board Directors
- Domains & Domain Leads
- Teams

### Working Group Members

All of the individuals that make up the Tauri Working Group.

### Tauri Board & Board Directors

The collective Board is the central decision making body for the Tauri Programme. Although the Tauri Board is ultimately responsible for decisions, they may delegate to Domain Leads as they see fit.

Individual Board Directors may not be directly involved in all areas and aspects of but they are responsible for performing Board duties to the best of their abilities.

### Domains & Domain Leads

Domains are organizational units that represent an area of interest within Tauri.

Domain Leads are trusted contributors within the Tauri community with expertise in the Domain they are leading. They are responsible for setting direction, overseeing and supporting the activities within that Domain.

The current Domains and Domain leads are outlined in the [Governance and Guidance repo on GitHub](https://github.com/tauri-apps/governance-and-guidance).

### Teams

Teams are small groups of contributors that support or maintain specific areas of the Tauri Programme. They are a means for Tauri to execute its longer-term tasks and goals, especially when ad-hoc contributions cannot achieve the same results.
